The Grimbots cover St Basil's Cathedral in green icing and Glitch loves it. Due to the cold weather the icing sets hard and traps some Cossack dancers inside. The Go Jetters come to help but the Grimbots trapped Lars and Foz in icing. Kyan distracts Glitch by joining some Cossack dancers to perform a birthday dance. Xuli uses GO Force set to heat to rescue Lars and Foz, who join her in melting the icing on the cathedral. It all melts and sends a tidal wave of icing into Red Square. They then have to use GO Force set to cold to freeze the icing and it traps Glitch. The Grimbots have to cut him out and carry him away.",
